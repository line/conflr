* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* conflr now works outside RStudio (e.g. Emacs/Vim) thanks to the power of
  askpass package (#10).

* conflr addin now has "Use original image sizes" option to control whether to resize
  the image (default) or not (#21).

  Markdown (#37, @ellisvalentiner).

  password as envvars (#48).

  automation (#44, @kazutan).
