# conflr

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/line/conflr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/line/conflr)

conflr is an R package to post [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents to [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), a content collaboration tool by Atlassian.

## Installation

You can install conflr from GitHub.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("line/conflr")
```

### Preparation

conflr uses these environmental variables to access your Confluence.

* `CONFLUENCE_URL`: The base URL of your Confluence. e.g. `https://confluence.example.com` (On Atlassian Cloud, `https://<your-domain>.atlassian.net/wiki`).
* `CONFLUENCE_USERNAME`: Your username (On Atlassian Cloud, your email address).
* `CONFLUENCE_PASSWORD`: Your password (On Atlassian Cloud, your API token. For more details about API token, please read [the official document](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)).

There are several ways to set these environmental variables. The quickest way is to enter in the popups that are displayed when you run the addin (see Usages section below). The inputs are cached in the environmental variables listed above by default. If you don't want to cache them, please set the following option.

```{r options, eval=FALSE}
options(conflr_dont_cache_envvar = TRUE)
```

Another way is to set the variables in the `.Renviron` file (you can open the file with `usethis::edit_r_environ()`). For example, you can set the base URL in the file as the following.

```
CONFLUENCE_URL=https://confluence.example.com
```

## Usage

### 1. Move focus to the .Rmd file and click "Post to Confluence" Addin

(**Caution for those who are not familiar with R Markdown**: R Markdown's powerfulness allows you to execute arbitrary code; be sure about what the code does before clicking "Post to Confluence"!)

Then, you will be asked your username and password.

### 2. Check the preview and click "Publish"

* **type**: The type of the page (*page* means a normal wiki page, whereas *blogpost* mean a blog post, not a page).
* **Space Key**: The key of the space you want to post.
* **Parent page ID**: (optional): The ID of the parent page to the page.

## Know limitations

### LaTeX support

conflr supports [Math expressions](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html#math-expressions) to some extent. But, it requires [LaTeX Math addon](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210882/latex-math) installed. Otherwise, you will see "unknown macro" errors on the page.

### htmlwidgets (e.g. leaflet, plotly)

conflr doesn't support htmlwidgets-based packages like leaflet and plotly.
Instead, you can embed the screenshot by setting `screenshot.force = TRUE` in the chunk option (c.f. https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html-widgets.html).

## Usage in console

```{r load_library, eval=FALSE}
library(conflr)

# list pages
res <- confl_list_pages(spaceKey = "foo")
purrr::map_chr(res$results, "id")

# get page info
page <- confl_get_page(res$results[[2]]$id)
page$title

# create a page
new_page <- confl_post_page(
  spaceKey = "foo",
  title = "Test",
  body = glue::glue(
    '<ac:structured-macro ac:name="code">
     <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[this is my code]]></ac:plain-text-body>
     </ac:structured-macro>
    '))
new_page$`_links`
```
